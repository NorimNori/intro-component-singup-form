##  📖 Overview

In this challenge, participants will practice building a responsive **sign-up form with client-side validation** using **JavaScript**. The objective is to create a landing page that closely matches the provided design. The form should allow users to input their details, providing **real-time feedback and error messages** for any issues.

**Key requirements for the challenge include:**

- Implementing a responsive layout that adjusts based on the user’s device screen size.
- Adding hover and focus states for all interactive elements.
- Validating the form to display error messages if:
  - Any input field is left empty.
  - The email address is incorrectly formatted.
  
Participants are encouraged to use any tools or libraries they feel comfortable with to complete the challenge, offering an opportunity to explore and practice different techniques while building the form.

###  🔬 What I learned

I learned that organizing components into folders with the same name can sometimes make imports a bit confusing. To address this, I implemented an `index.js` file in each folder to simplify and clarify the import process. Additionally, I gained valuable experience in creating **custom hooks** and **handling form validation errors**, which enhanced both the functionality and user experience of the form.
